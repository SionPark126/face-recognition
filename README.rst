This is a very simple face detection and recognition implementation in python.
It uses opencv to detect faces and
`eigenfaces <https://github.com/antonyross/eigenfaces>`_ to recognize the faces.

Press any key after every shot to take a new one.

Demo
====

To test face recognition use the demo that captures view from your webcam
and recognizes faces in realtime::

    $ python src/main.py demo

Requirements
